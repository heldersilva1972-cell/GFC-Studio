🛠️ The Essential Git Cheat Sheet
1. Starting a New Task (Branching)
Always create a branch before you start typing new code.

Create and switch to a new branch: git checkout -b feature-name

Switch back to the main branch: git checkout master (or main)

List all your local branches: git branch

2. Saving Your Work (Committing)
This creates the "restore point" we discussed earlier.

Stage all changes (prepare for the snapshot): git add .

Commit the changes with a message: git commit -m "Brief description of what you did"

3. Combining Work (Merging)
When your feature is finished and tested, you bring it back to the main line.

Step 1: Switch to the branch you want to merge into (usually master): git checkout master

Step 2: Pull the feature branch code in: git merge feature-name

4. Safety & Navigation
Check the status (See what files are changed/staged): git status

View your history (The text version of that graph you sent): git log --oneline --graph

Undo your last commit (Keep your code changes but "un-save" the point): git reset --soft HEAD~1

💡 Pro-Tips for Success
Pull before you Push: Always run git pull before starting work to make sure you have the latest code from your teammates.

The "Commit Message" Rule: Try to make your messages imperative (e.g., "Add login button" instead of "I added a button"). It makes the history much easier to read.

Don't Panic: Almost anything in Git can be undone. If you get stuck in a "Merge Conflict," your editor will usually highlight the conflicting lines in red and blue to let you choose which one to keep.
