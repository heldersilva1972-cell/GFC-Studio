GFC ECOSYSTEM – AUTHORITATIVE CONTINUATION REPORT
SECTION 04 – ANIMATION PLAYGROUND
ECOSYSTEM VERSION: v1.0.0
SECTION REVISION: R2
GENERATED: 2025-12-13

================================================================================
PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT
================================================================================
This document is the authoritative continuation report for **Animation Playground**
as it exists inside the GFC Ecosystem. It is written so that it can be uploaded
into any new chat and provide complete continuity about:

- What Animation Playground was created for (historical intent)
- What is certainly complete vs partial vs not implemented
- How Animation Playground is intended to merge into **GFC Web Studio**
- Exactly what was discussed about that merge
- Exactly what has NOT yet been decided (REQUIRED GAPS)
- A step-by-step execution blueprint written in dependency order
- A clear “Prompt Path” to generate safe Cursor prompts per step

SCOPE RULES (LOCKED BY USER):
- Include ONLY explicitly discussed items PLUS clearly marked REQUIRED GAPS needed
  to complete the system.
- No speculative features, no placeholders.

================================================================================
SECTION A – ORIGINAL PROJECT INTENT (HISTORICAL TRUTH)
================================================================================
Animation Playground was created as:
- A sandbox to design and test animations quickly without risking core systems
- A proving ground for motion UX concepts (simple + advanced)
- A catalog of reusable, parameterized animation assets
- A safe environment to iterate on JSON-based animation definitions

It was never intended to:
- Contain membership logic or access control logic
- Serve as a member-facing production UI
- Replace the Web App
- Become a long-term parallel product competing with Studio

================================================================================
SECTION B – RELATIONSHIP TO STUDIO (AUTHORITATIVE MERGE INTENT)
================================================================================
This section is critical. It encodes what was explicitly discussed and agreed
about **Animation Playground ↔ Studio**. This is NOT a guess; it is a continuation
anchor intended to prevent future chats from misinterpreting the system.

------------------------------------------------------------
B1. Merge Direction (EXPLICITLY DISCUSSED)
------------------------------------------------------------
- Animation Playground is the *source system / precursor*
- GFC Web Studio is the *destination / long-term home*
- Studio is intended to *subsume* Playground capability

Plain-English statement:
  Studio is expected to become “Playground + more”.
  Playground is not expected to remain a separate parallel end-user product.

------------------------------------------------------------
B2. Non-Destructive Rule (EXPLICITLY DISCUSSED)
------------------------------------------------------------
A repeated guiding principle:
- Animations must not be removed during expansion or merge
- New animations are added; existing ones remain available
- The merge must preserve:
  - existing animation definitions
  - parameters
  - categories
  - viewing/preview capability
- If an animation becomes obsolete, it is deprecated, not deleted

This rule exists to protect continuity and prevent “lost work” during integration.

------------------------------------------------------------
B3. “Studio is More Than Playground” (EXPLICITLY DISCUSSED)
------------------------------------------------------------
Playground focuses on:
- authoring, preview, experimentation, parameter tuning

Studio adds:
- page composition & content editing (layout/sections/components)
- admin-safe editing (guardrails, permissions, saved drafts)
- responsive editing modes (desktop/tablet/mobile)
- undo / rollback (including “single-animation undo”)
- integration into Web App (launcher, permissions, safe navigation)

Therefore:
- Studio is not a rename
- Studio is the production editing system built upon Playground outputs

------------------------------------------------------------
B4. “Playground May Remain as a Developer Tool” (DISCUSSED, NOT FINALIZED)
------------------------------------------------------------
A recurring concept (but NOT locked):
- After Studio exists, Playground might remain as:
  - a developer-only sandbox for making new animations
  - an advanced “lab” environment
- Studio would remain the admin-facing environment

IMPORTANT:
This is a possible end-state, not a final decision. It must be treated as a
REQUIRED GAP decision in later steps.

------------------------------------------------------------
B5. Source of Truth After Merge (DISCUSSED, NOT FINALIZED)
------------------------------------------------------------
What was discussed:
- Studio becomes the main interface and long-term home
- Playground is the origin and may remain for authoring

What was NOT finalized:
- Whether Studio becomes the only place where animations are edited
- Whether Playground continues to author animations that are then imported
- Whether Studio and Playground share a common runtime/editor

This is a REQUIRED GAP because it affects:
- data model
- versioning
- import/export pipeline
- duplication risks

================================================================================

E3. Import/Export to Studio (repeatable, non-manual pipeline)
E4. Automated Validation of Studio-native JSON (pre-merge checks)
E5. Dependency Mapping Between Animations (optional if animations are independent)
E6. Definitive “post-merge authoring model” (decision)

================================================================================
SECTION F – REQUIRED GAPS (MUST BE RESOLVED TO COMPLETE MERGE)
================================================================================
These are not guesses; they are decisions required to safely complete the merge.

[REQUIRED GAP – MERGE END-STATE DECISION]
F1. Post-merge authoring model (must choose one):
- Model A: Studio-only authoring (Playground becomes obsolete)
- Model B: Playground authors; Studio consumes (import pipeline required)
- Model C: Shared runtime/editor (single codebase, two entry points)

Why required:
- Determines where edits happen
- Prevents dual-source conflicts
- Controls tool complexity

[REQUIRED GAP – CANONICAL DATA OWNERSHIP]
F2. After merge, where is the single source of truth stored?
- In Studio database tables only?
- In JSON files stored in repo?
- In both (with strict sync rules)?

Why required:
- Determines persistence, backups, migrations, auditability

[REQUIRED GAP – COMPATIBILITY CONTRACT]
F3. Define the Studio “ingestion contract”:
- Required JSON fields
- Parameter definitions and constraints
- Backward compatibility rules
- Deprecation rules

Why required:
- Prevents broken animations from entering Studio

[REQUIRED GAP – ROLLBACK/UNDO CONTRACT]
F4. Define rollback granularity expectations:
- Single-animation undo
- Page-level rollback
- Full workspace rollback

Why required:
- Impacts versioning and storage design

================================================================================
SECTION G – EXECUTION BLUEPRINT (DETAILED, DEPENDENCY ORDER)
================================================================================
The steps below are written to complete Animation Playground’s role in the merge
into Studio while preserving all prior work.

Each step includes:
- Purpose
- Detailed substeps
- Acceptance tests
- Prompt Path (how to create Cursor prompts safely)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1 — Define Canonical Animation Metadata Schema (for Studio Ingestion)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
Create a canonical schema so Studio can ingest Playground animations without
manual interpretation. The schema must preserve existing animation definitions.

Preconditions:
- Inventory existing animation definition fields (current JSON structure)
- Identify parameter types currently used (number, boolean, enum, string, etc.)

Substeps:
1.1 Define required fields (minimum)
- animationId (stable)
- name
- category
- description (optional but recommended)
- version
- parameters[] (name, type, default, constraints, description)
- runtimeDefinition (the actual studio-native animation payload)
- tags (optional)
- deprecationStatus (active/deprecated) with reason (optional)

1.2 Define parameter constraints
- numeric ranges (min/max)
- enums (allowed values)
- strings (length, regex if needed)
- required vs optional parameters

1.3 Define compatibility rules
- Adding parameters: allowed if defaults exist
- Removing parameters: not allowed (must deprecate)
- Renaming parameters: treated as breaking unless alias support exists
- Changing type: breaking

1.4 Implement a validator (Playground-side)
- Validate all existing animations against schema
- Produce actionable error messages

Acceptance Tests:
- Validator runs on all existing animations
- All animations either pass or produce clear fix messages
- No animation is lost or removed because of schema enforcement

PROMPT PATH:
Prompt Set: PLAYGROUND-STEP1-SCHEMA
Inputs required:
- Exact file locations of animation definitions
- Current JSON shape examples
Scope rules:
- Create/modify only schema + validation utilities (no Studio integration yet)
Suggested prompt breakdown:
1) Define schema types + docs
2) Implement validator and CLI/script entry point
3) Run validator and fix schema mismatches (separate prompt)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2 — Add Formal Animation Versioning + Changelog Rules
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
Enable safe evolution without breaking Studio ingestion.

Preconditions:
- Schema from Step 1 exists
- Decision on versioning style (semantic vs incremental) is required

Substeps:
2.1 Choose versioning rule (SPEC REQUIRED)
- Recommended: semantic major/minor/patch at animation level

2.2 Embed version into each animation definition
- Ensure every animation has a version field

2.3 Add per-animation changelog (structured)
- At minimum:
  - date
  - change summary
  - breaking? yes/no
  - migration notes if breaking (ideally none)

2.4 Add validation checks
- Changelog required if version changed
- Breaking changes require major bump

Acceptance Tests:
- Each animation shows a version
- Validator flags missing changelog entries when version updates
- Non-destructive rule enforced (no deletion)

PROMPT PATH:
Prompt Set: PLAYGROUND-STEP2-VERSIONING
Scope:
- Version fields + changelog structures + validator updates only

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 3 — Define and Implement Export (or Shared Registry) for Studio
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
Create a repeatable path to get animations into Studio without copy/paste.

Preconditions:
- Required GAP F1 must be selected (authoring model)
- Required GAP F2 must be selected (source of truth storage)

Substeps (depends on authoring model):
Model B (Playground authors, Studio consumes):
3.1 Implement export command
- Export animations in the canonical schema
- Output location defined (folder or endpoint)

3.2 Implement Studio-side import
- Studio reads exported bundle
- Validates schema
- Registers animations

3.3 Add compatibility checks
- Reject invalid payloads
- Keep last-known-good registry

Model C (shared runtime/editor):
3.x Implement shared registry module
- Single codebase used by both
- Shared schema validation

Acceptance Tests:
- Studio loads all animations from exported/registry source
- No parameter loss
- Errors surfaced clearly and do not break Studio runtime

PROMPT PATH:
Prompt Set: PLAYGROUND-STEP3-EXPORT
Inputs required:
- Studio registry location and ingestion design
- Target folder/DB scheme chosen
Scope rules:
- One issue per prompt:
  (a) export pipeline, (b) Studio import/registry, (c) validation + safeguards

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 4 — Lock Non-Destructive Guards + Deprecation Process
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
Prevent accidental removal and ensure safe evolution after merge.

Substeps:
4.1 Add guardrails
- Prevent deletion from registry unless explicit “hard delete” admin-only process exists
- Default behavior: deprecate only

4.2 Deprecation UX rules (for Studio)
- Deprecated animations remain selectable only with warnings, or hidden by default
- Document reasons and replacement suggestions

4.3 Breaking change protection
- If a runtime definition changes incompatibly, require new animationId rather than mutate old

Acceptance Tests:
- Attempted deletion is blocked or gated
- Deprecation is visible and reversible
- Existing Studio pages using an animation do not break silently

PROMPT PATH:
Prompt Set: PLAYGROUND-STEP4-GUARDS
Scope:
- Guardrails + documentation additions only

================================================================================
SECTION H – CONSTRAINTS & NON-GOALS
================================================================================
- Do NOT add business logic or controller logic
- Do NOT remove existing animations
- Do NOT introduce dual-edit conflicts without selecting an authoring model
- Playground remains safe experimentation; Studio is the production editor home

================================================================================
