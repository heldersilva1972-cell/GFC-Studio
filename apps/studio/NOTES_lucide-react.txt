LUCIDE-REACT INSTALLATION NOTES
================================

1. DEPENDENCY ADDED
   - lucide-react version ^0.460.0 has been added to package.json dependencies.

2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
   - You MUST run npm install from CMD (Command Prompt), NOT PowerShell.
   - PowerShell has execution policy restrictions that prevent npm from running.
   
   Steps:
   a) Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe)
   b) Navigate to this project folder:
      cd "C:\Users\hnsil\Documents\GFC\cursor files\animation playground"
   c) Run:
      npm install
   
   This will install all dependencies including lucide-react.

3. REINSTALL JUST LUCIDE-REACT (if needed)
   - If you need to reinstall just lucide-react, run from CMD:
      npm install lucide-react

4. VERIFICATION
   - After installation, verify the package is installed by checking:
      node_modules/lucide-react
   - The module should resolve correctly in your Next.js app.

5. TROUBLESHOOTING
   - If you still see "Module not found" errors after installation:
     a) Delete the .next folder
     b) Restart your Next.js dev server
     c) Clear your browser cache
