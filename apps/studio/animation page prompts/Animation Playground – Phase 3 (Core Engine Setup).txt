# Animation Playground – Phase 3 (Core Engine Setup)
# Revision: AP-P3-R1
# This prompt must be executed in Cursor as ONE complete block.

GOAL:
Create the core animation engine that all future Phase 4–7 animations will rely on.
This engine must be modular, component-based, and designed to support the
Phase 5.xB (standard animations) and Phase 5.xA (advanced animations).

STACK:
• Next.js + React + TypeScript
• TailwindCSS
• Framer Motion
• Component-based file structure (app/animations/*)
• Utility-first design so animations can be reused anywhere

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a new folder:
   /app/animations/core/

2. Create the following files:
   • AnimationContainer.tsx
   • AnimationSelector.tsx
   • AnimationRegistry.ts
   • types.ts
   • useAnimationEngine.ts (custom hook)

3. BASE ARCHITECTURE:
   • AnimationContainer renders any animation component dynamically
   • AnimationSelector allows UI selection (Phase 3) — later Phase 4 adds editing tools
   • AnimationRegistry stores a list of ALL animations (Phase 5.xB + 5.xA)
   • useAnimationEngine controls shared state (speed, size, colors, etc.)

4. ANIMATION ENGINE FEATURES:
   • global animation speed control
   • global size scale control
   • global color theme system
   • dark/light theme compatibility
   • ability to pass props to animations
   • supports children animations
   • supports advanced animations (5.xA requirements)

5. Provide placeholder demo animations:
   • PulseCircle
   • SlidingSquare
   • FloatingText

6. Add registry entries for ALL placeholders (future phases will add real ones).

7. Export everything cleanly so Phase 4 (Editor Tools) can plug in.

8. Styling Rules:
   • Tailwind only
   • no grey backgrounds
   • clean modern UI
   • rounded-xl containers
   • subtle shadows
   • responsive layout

OUTPUT:
Provide complete working code for ALL new files + the updated folder structure.

DO NOT:
• Do NOT scaffold Phase 4
• Do NOT add any Phase 5 animations yet
• Do NOT remove placeholder animations
