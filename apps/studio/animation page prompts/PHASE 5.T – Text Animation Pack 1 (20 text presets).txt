// PROJECT: Animation Playground – Main
// PHASE: 5.T – Text Animation Pack 1 (20 text presets)
// REV: 2025-11-28-01
// GOAL: Add a new "Text FX" preset group with 20 text-only animations, wired into the existing Animation Playground UI. Do NOT remove or rename any existing phases/animations; only add.

You are working in the standalone Animation Playground project (Next.js App Router, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Framer Motion). Follow the existing architecture and patterns already used for animation presets, categories, tiles, and the viewer.

HIGH-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
1) Add a new preset category called "Text FX" (or similar, e.g. "Text Animations") in whatever registry currently drives the category buttons and tiles on the Playground page.
2) Add 20 new animation presets under this category, each implemented as a reusable React component using Framer Motion. They must be text-centric effects.
3) Each preset must:
   - Use a shared Typed props shape, e.g. `AnimatedTextProps { text?: string; subText?: string; accentColor?: string; }`.
   - Have a sensible default text (e.g. "Animation Playground", "I ❤ U", etc.), but read text/subText from props so future integration with the GFC website is easy.
   - Be responsive and look good centered in the current viewer area (no layout shifting the whole page).
4) Wire all 20 into the existing preset/registry system so:
   - Category buttons filter correctly.
   - Tiles show the correct thumbnail/title/description.
   - Selecting a tile loads the correct component in the viewer.

ANIMATION LIST (IMPLEMENT ALL 20)
Implement each as its own component in a dedicated folder such as `components/animations/text` (or match existing patterns). Use Framer Motion, Tailwind, and minimal custom CSS.

1) Neon Pulse Glow
   - Name: "Neon Pulse Glow"
   - Behavior: Text in a bold font with outer glow; per-letter sequential fade-in, with a looping soft pulse and subtle flicker.

2) Digital Flip Clock
   - Name: "Digital Flip Clock"
   - Behavior: Characters appear via vertical flip-card motion like an old digital clock, staggered per character.

3) Typewriter Ink Bleed
   - Name: "Typewriter Ink Bleed"
   - Behavior: Typewriter typing effect (per-character) with a slight ink-bleed/ripple expansion on each letter as it appears.

4) Liquid Wave Text
   - Name: "Liquid Wave"
   - Behavior: Text emerges from a liquid-like wave distortion; small vertical sinusoidal motion rippling across letters.

5) Particle Burst Reveal
   - Name: "Particle Burst"
   - Behavior: Each character starts as tiny scattered dots that converge into the proper letter; use small circles/divs and opacity/motion instead of real particles.

6) Floating Balloon Letters
   - Name: "Balloon Float"
   - Behavior: Each letter gently floats upward and bobs, with soft scale-in from below.

7) Metallic Shine Sweep
   - Name: "Metallic Shine"
   - Behavior: A diagonal shine passes across the text in a loop; use gradient mask/clip or pseudo overlay with motion to simulate reflection.

8) Explode → Reform
   - Name: "Explode & Reform"
   - Behavior: Text starts intact, explodes outward into pieces (letters or letter fragments), then reassembles into the original text.

9) Flame Text Morph
   - Name: "Flame Flicker"
   - Behavior: Letters flicker vertically/opacity like fire, with warm colors and subtle vertical noise/scale wiggle.

10) Laser Beam Writing
    - Name: "Laser Write"
    - Behavior: A horizontal "laser" bar sweeps from left to right; letters appear as the beam passes, with small spark-like flashes at the edges.

11) Glitch Scramble Decode
    - Name: "Glitch Decode"
    - Behavior: Characters rapidly scramble through random letters/symbols before locking into the target text; include slight RGB offset jitter.

12) Origami Fold Text
    - Name: "Origami Fold"
    - Behavior: Each letter folds open from a flat line via 3D-ish rotation on X/Y; use perspective-like transform and easing.

13) 3D Rotation Carousel
    - Name: "3D Carousel Text"
    - Behavior: Whole text rotates in 3D around Y (like on a cylinder), briefly hiding and revealing the message; loop slowly.

14) Ice Freeze → Crack
    - Name: "Ice Crack Reveal"
    - Behavior: Text appears frosted (cool colors, blur), then a cracking animation (scale/opacity jitter with overlays) reveals sharp clear text.

15) Bubble Pop Reveal
    - Name: "Bubble Pop"
    - Behavior: Small bubbles float up; when they pop (scale out/fade), a letter appears in their place.

16) Warp Speed Stretch
    - Name: "Warp Speed"
    - Behavior: Text streaks from the center as stretched lines, then decelerates into clear letters; strong motion blur effect via scale/skew.

17) Ribbon Text Unfold
    - Name: "Ribbon Unfold"
    - Behavior: A horizontal ribbon sweeps across; as it moves, letters are "unwrapped" from the ribbon via masked reveal.

18) Chromatic RGB Split
    - Name: "Chromatic Split"
    - Behavior: Slight continuous RGB split offset on the text; on hover or loop moments, intensify the split and then snap back.

19) Electric Arc Stitching
    - Name: "Electric Stitch"
    - Behavior: Electric arcs travel along an imagined baseline, and as they pass a letter position, that letter appears; arcs use jagged motion and glow.

20) Ink Calligraphy Stroke
    - Name: "Calligraphy Stroke"
    - Behavior: A moving stroke reveals each letter as if hand-written; approximate via masked text + moving gradient/clipRect.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
1) Registry / Config
   - Locate the animation registry/config (the source of truth for presets, categories, and tiles).
   - Add a new category entry: id `"text-fx"`, label `"Text FX"`, icon/emoji if used (e.g. "🅰️").
   - Add 20 animation entries under this category, each with:
     - id (kebab-case, e.g. `neon-pulse-glow`),
     - title,
     - short description,
     - component reference,
     - tags: include `"text"` + effect tags (`"neon"`, `"glitch"`, `"3d"`, etc.).

2) Components
   - Create a shared `AnimatedTextProps` interface and base wrapper in `components/animations/text/AnimatedTextBase.tsx` (or similar) for layout and central positioning.
   - Each of the 20 components:
     - Accepts `AnimatedTextProps`.
     - Uses Tailwind for centering and typography.
     - Uses Framer Motion for all animation.
     - Renders well against the existing dark-theme background.

3) Playground Integration
   - Ensure the category button row shows the new "Text FX" category and filtering works.
   - Ensure tiles for all 20 new presets appear correctly and load their respective component into the viewer when clicked.
   - Viewer should keep the animation centered and not shift the page scroll; if needed, adjust the viewer container to fixed height with internal scroll, per previous layout goals.

4) Quality / DX
   - Keep code clean, typed, and consistent with existing patterns.
   - Add brief JSDoc comments for each animation component describing the effect (1–2 lines).
   - Verify no TypeScript errors and no broken imports.

Finally, run through the Playground page and visually verify that:
- The new "Text FX" category appears,
- All 20 animations render and loop as described,
- Switching categories and selecting tiles behaves correctly with no layout jumps.
