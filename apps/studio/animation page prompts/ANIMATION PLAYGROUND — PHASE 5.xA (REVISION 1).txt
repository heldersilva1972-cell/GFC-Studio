# ANIMATION PLAYGROUND — PHASE 5.xA (REVISION 1)
# PURPOSE: Add 3 new advanced animations to the standalone Animation Playground.
# RULES: Do NOT remove any existing animations from 5.1–5.10. Only add new ones.
# STACK: Next.js App Router, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Framer Motion.
# TARGET FILES: /app/animations/*, /app/components/AnimationViewer, /app/data/animationList.ts

PHASE GOALS:
1) Add 3 advanced animations:
   A) Hologram Grid Warp
   B) Particle Swarm Ribbon
   C) Fractal Pulse Tunnel
2) Each animation must:
   - Render inside AnimationViewer center-aligned
   - Use Framer Motion + Canvas/WebGL when needed
   - Have fully commented code
   - Export as a React component in /app/animations/
   - Work with existing selector UI
3) Update animationList.ts to include:
   id, title, description, componentPath, difficulty:"advanced"
4) Improve layout:
   - Center stage, responsive, max-w-5xl, backdrop-blur
   - Dark theme only
   - Add “Advanced” badge on menu items
5) Keep backward compatibility with Phase 5.xB originals.

TASKS:
1. Create files:
   /app/animations/HologramGridWarp.tsx
   /app/animations/ParticleSwarmRibbon.tsx
   /app/animations/FractalPulseTunnel.tsx
2. Implement animations:
   A) Hologram Grid Warp
      - Glowing neon grid reacting to mouse movement
      - Perspective skew + z-depth motion
      - Motion blur lines when user moves pointer
   B) Particle Swarm Ribbon
      - 500–1500 particles following a noise field
      - Particles form a long flowing ribbon path
      - Smooth camera drift (Framer Motion)
   C) Fractal Pulse Tunnel
      - Animated recursive rings
      - Depth zoom traveling through tunnel
      - Pulse sync glow + hue shifting
3. Add comments explaining logic & math.
4. Update AnimationViewer:
   - Center content
   - Add dynamic stage scaling based on animation size
5. Update menu layout:
   - New “Advanced Animations” section divider
   - Each advanced animation uses a purple gradient tile
6. Ensure imports use lazy() + dynamic() for optimization.
7. Final verification:
   - Run `npm run dev`
   - Ensure each animation loads without blocking UI
   - Confirm mobile responsiveness
