REV: AnimationPlayground / Phase 4A – Structure & Navigation / v1

GOAL
Introduce a clean internal structure for the Animation Playground before the big UI redesign in Phase 4B. Centralize animation metadata, standardize navigation, and create reusable layout components, while keeping the visual style simple for now.

CONTEXT
- This project is the standalone “Animation Playground” (NOT the GFC web app).
- Stack: Next.js App Router, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion.
- Phases 1–4 are already implemented with routes/components and a main playground page that currently shows simple text links.

IMPORTANT
- Do NOT remove or rename existing animation components or routes.
- Do NOT implement the 4B card/grid layout or hero yet. Phase 4A is about structure and navigation, not full visual redesign.
- All existing animations must remain accessible exactly as before (same URLs/IDs).

TASKS

1) CENTRAL ANIMATION REGISTRY
Create a central registry for all animations:

- File (adjust path if needed but keep it in the app tree):  
  `app/animations/registry.ts` (or `src/app/...` if that’s the existing structure)

- Define a TypeScript type for metadata, e.g.:

  - `id: string` – unique key used for selection/routing (must match existing usage).
  - `name: string` – human-readable title.
  - `description: string` – 1–2 line description.
  - `category?: "basic" | "intermediate" | "advanced" | string` – optional.
  - `difficulty?: number` – optional 1–3 scale.
  - `route?: string` – if an animation already lives on its own route.
  - `component?: React.ComponentType` – if there is a shared demo component.
  - Any other fields that already exist from earlier phases.

- Export:
  - `export type AnimationMeta = { ... }`
  - `export const animations: AnimationMeta[] = [ ... ]`

- Make sure every animation previously linked on the main page is represented in this array using the same IDs/paths that are already wired up.

2) REFRESH MAIN PLAYGROUND PAGE TO USE REGISTRY
Find the main Animation Playground page (the one with the current list of animation links). Typically something like:

- `app/animation-playground/page.tsx`  
  or  
- `app/animations/page.tsx`

Refactor it to:

- Import `animations` from the registry.
- Render the list using `animations.map(...)` instead of hardcoding.
- Keep the list visually simple in this phase:
  - A heading (“Animation Playground”).
  - A simple description line.
  - A vertical list of clickable items.

Implementation details:

- For each item:
  - Show `name` and a small description.
  - Link to the correct route:
    - If `route` is present in the registry, use that value.
    - Otherwise construct URLs in the same way the current links do (e.g. `/animations/[id]`).
- Use Tailwind for some **light** styling to make it cleaner than bare links:
  - e.g. `space-y-2`, `rounded-lg`, `border`, `p-3`, `hover:bg-slate-50`.
- Use `next/link` for navigation, keep behavior identical to before.

3) SIMPLE ACTIVE STATE (NO BIG UI YET)
Add a lightweight way to visually indicate which animation is currently “selected” when you are on the main page:

- For now, selection can be:
  - Either derived from query parameters or local state.
  - Or simply not wired to the URL yet and just local state on click.
- Minimal approach:
  - When you click a list item, set it as “selected” in component state and:
    - Add a class like `border-blue-500 bg-blue-50` to that item.
- Do NOT implement the full right-hand preview panel yet. That’s for Phase 4B.

4) SHARED LAYOUT COMPONENT FOR INDIVIDUAL DEMOS
If your animation demos live in separate routes (like `/animations/bounce`, `/animations/fade`, etc.), introduce a shared layout wrapper component to keep them consistent:

- Create something like:  
  `app/animations/components/AnimationDemoLayout.tsx`

- Responsibilities:
  - Render a simple header with the animation name.
  - Render children as the demo area.
  - Include a small “Back to Playground” link that navigates back to the main playground page.
  - Use Tailwind for a basic yet clean layout (padding, max-width container, etc.).

- Update the existing animation demo pages to wrap their demo content with this layout:
  - Do not change their core animation logic, only wrap the JSX.
  - If a page doesn’t currently have a clear title, derive it from the registry entry where possible.

5) REGISTRY → DEMO PAGES HOOKUP (OPTIONAL BUT PREFERRED)
Where practical (and without breaking anything):

- Use the registry to avoid duplicated titles/descriptions:
  - For example, a demo page can import `animations` and find its own metadata by `id` to display the correct `name` or `description` in the header.
- Keep this logic simple and resilient:
  - If a matching entry isn’t found, fall back to a hard-coded string so no page crashes.

6) TYPES & CLEANUP
- Keep TypeScript strict:
  - Use `AnimationMeta` wherever animation metadata is handled.
  - Avoid `any` unless unavoidable in this phase.
- Clean up obvious unused imports or dead code on the main playground page and demo pages while refactoring, as long as it does not change behavior.

7) DO NOT IMPLEMENT 4B FEATURES YET
Explicitly avoid implementing the following in Phase 4A (they will be done in Phase 4B):

- No multi-column, card-grid layout for animations.
- No full-page hero with advanced motion.
- No dedicated preview panel on the right side.
- No code viewer panel.

This phase is about **structure, consistency, and navigation** only.

AFTER CHANGES
- Run the dev server.
- Verify:
  - The project builds and runs.
  - All previous animation routes still work.
  - The main Animation Playground page now reads from the centralized registry.
  - The demo pages (if present) now share a consistent layout with a “Back to Playground” link.
- Keep all this as groundwork so Phase 4B can focus purely on visual/UI upgrade.

Apply all of the above in a single pass, updating only the files that are needed to implement Phase 4A.
