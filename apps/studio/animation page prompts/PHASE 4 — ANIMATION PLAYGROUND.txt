PHASE 4 — ANIMATION PLAYGROUND
REVISION: AP-PH4-R1

GOAL:
Implement the Animation Preview Window + Copy-Code system.

OUTPUT OF THIS PHASE:
A working preview panel where the user can see an animation running AND a code window showing the full code for that animation with a COPY button.

STACK:
Next.js + React + TypeScript + Tailwind.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. CREATE THE ANIMATION PREVIEW PANEL
   • A centered preview area where any animation component can be rendered.
   • Should accept an <AnimationComponent /> prop.
   • White background, rounded edges, small shadow.

2. ADD ANIMATION SELECTION (TEMPORARY FOR NOW)
   • A simple select dropdown listing all existing animations from Phase 5.xB (initial 10 animations).
   • When user chooses an animation, the preview updates.

3. CREATE THE CODE DISPLAY WINDOW
   • A full-width code display area directly below the preview.
   • Should auto-load the complete source code for the selected animation.
   • Use a syntax-highlighted code box (Prism.js or similar).
   • MUST have a green "Copy Code" button.
   • Copy button copies the entire code window to clipboard.

4. FILE LOADING RULES
   • Code should be loaded from actual animation source files under /animations/.
   • When a new animation is added in Phase 5.1A/5.2A/etc, Phase 4 must support them automatically.

5. UI/UX RULES
   • Modern look.
   • Smooth fade transitions between animations.
   • Keep everything in one clean layout.
   • On mobile, code window collapses into toggleable accordion.

6. COMPONENTS TO CREATE
   • components/AnimationPreview.tsx
   • components/CodeDisplay.tsx
   • components/AnimationSelector.tsx
   • pages/playground/index.tsx (main page with layout)

7. DO NOT:
   • Do not implement any new animations yet.
   • Do not add advanced features until Phase 6.
   • Do not remove existing Phase 5 animations.

AFTER COMPLETION:
Ask user: “Do you want to continue to Phase 5.1A?”
