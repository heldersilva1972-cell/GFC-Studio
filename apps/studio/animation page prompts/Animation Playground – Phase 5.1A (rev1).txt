# Animation Playground – Phase 5.1A (rev1)
# Purpose: Add Advanced Animation Type A (“Morphing Shape Flow”) to existing system.
# Standalone Next.js/TS/Tailwind/Framer Motion animation project. Do NOT alter existing animations (5.1–5.10). Only add.

PHASE_GOAL:
- Add new advanced animation type: "Morphing Shape Flow"
- Make it available inside the animation selector
- Render live preview + copy-code panel
- Use component-based architecture consistent with prior phases

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Add new animation folder: /animations/advanced/MorphingShapeFlow
2. Include:
   - index.ts (export config + component)
   - MorphingShapeFlow.tsx (animation component)
   - code.ts (string literal containing full copy-able code)
3. Animation behavior:
   - Smooth morphing between 3–6 SVG shapes (circle, squircle, blob, star)
   - Gradient fill that shifts over time
   - Slow rotational drift (Framer Motion)
   - Tailwind-safe colors only
4. Settings object must define:
   id: "morphingShapeFlow"
   name: "Morphing Shape Flow"
   category: "Advanced"
   complexity: 5
   previewSize: "md"
5. Update:
   - animations/index.ts to include new animation
   - animationRegistry.ts to register it
   - UI selector to show category “Advanced”
6. Preview window:
   - Show animation centered in panel
   - Maintain 1:1 aspect ratio
7. Code panel:
   - Display imported code string
   - Provide “Copy Code” button (existing utility)
8. Do not break existing animations.

IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS:
- CREATE /animations/advanced/MorphingShapeFlow/MorphingShapeFlow.tsx
- CREATE /animations/advanced/MorphingShapeFlow/code.ts
- CREATE /animations/advanced/MorphingShapeFlow/index.ts
- UPDATE /animations/index.ts (append export)
- UPDATE /animationRegistry.ts (append to registry)
- UPDATE UI selector to show category “Advanced”
- Ensure build succeeds without modifying any previous animation.

NOTES:
- Use Framer Motion <motion.svg> + path morphing
- Shapes stored as const PATH1, PATH2, PATH3, PATH4
- Morph cycle duration ~6–10s
- Ensure animation loops infinitely (easeInOut)

OUTPUT EXPECTATION:
- Cursor should generate the new files + update existing ones with minimal edits.
- After running, user should see new animation available in selector.
