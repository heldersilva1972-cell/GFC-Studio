# PHASE 8-1: ACCESS CONTROL V2

**Objective:** Enhance the physical security integration with advanced logic.

## 1. Advanced Scheduling
- [ ] **Holiday Engine**: Configuration UI to define "Holiday" dates that override standard door schedules (e.g., Closed on Christmas).
- [ ] **Special Events**: "One-Off" overrides (e.g., Unlock for a Hall Rental on a Tuesday night).

## 2. Anti-Passback & Logic
- [ ] **Logic engine**: If hardware supports it, enforce logic that a key card cannot be used to enter twice without an exit (preventing card passing).
*Note: Dependent on hardware capabilities.*

## 3. Hardware Traceability
- [ ] **Deep Logging**: Extended logging of raw Controller messages for debugging.
