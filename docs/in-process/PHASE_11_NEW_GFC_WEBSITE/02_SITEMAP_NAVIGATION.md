## 🔄 Modular Logic (Removal Policy)
As requested, sections are built to be **Independent**.
- *Example:* If you decide not to have a "Member Login," removing it from the Header does not break the layout of the other items. They automatically re-center and balance.
- *Example:* If "Our Impact" isn't ready, the navigation item and page can be hidden with one click in Studio.
