# Plan: Camera System Integration - Phase 5: Management & Security Suite
**Project:** GFC Camera Viewer  
**Status:** Completion & Hardening Phase  

## 🎯 Objective
Provide a simplified, secure "Command Center" for all camera configurations and a high-speed "Visual Activity Gallery" for daily monitoring.

## 🏗️ Technical Checklist

### 1. Camera Management UI
- [ ] **Create Camera Settings Page**: Use a clean, card-based layout. [**TAG: NEW**]
    - **Door/Camera Linker**: Simple dropdowns to assign Camera 01 to Front Door, etc.
    - **Timing Config**: Adjust pre-roll/post-roll seconds for the Archive.
    - **Storage Monitor**: A visual "Fuel Gauge" showing HDD usage.
- [ ] **Credential Handshake**: A secure UI for updating NVR IP and Admin login.

### 2. High-Speed "Visual Activity Gallery"
- [ ] **Design Gallery Page**: A list of recent entries with large thumbnails and Names. [**TAG: NEW**]
- [ ] **Quick Filters**: One-tap buttons for "Today", "Yesterday", or "Find Member".

### 3. Security Hardening
- [ ] **Implement One-Time Tokens (OTT)**: Video URLs must contain a 60-second expiring token generated by the server.
- [ ] **Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensure only users with "Security Admin" permissions can see the Settings or Archive pages.
- [ ] **Internal Audit Logging**: Log every instance of someone viewing an archived video clip.
- [ ] **Metadata Privacy**: Ensure NVR passwords never leave the Local Agent PC.

### 4. System Vitals
- [ ] **Implement Camera Health Check**: A 60-minute recurring service that verifies camera online/offline status.
- [ ] **Alert Integration**: If a camera goes offline, push a "Danger" alert to the GFC Dashboard. [**TAG: MODIFIED**]

## 🚀 Success Criteria
- [ ] **Ease of Use**: A non-technical user can link a door to a camera in under 10 seconds.
- [ ] **Security**: External attempts to access Video URLs result in "403 Forbidden" due to token mismatch.
- [ ] **Reliability**: Dashboard accurately reflects camera health (LED turns red if NVR loses power).
- [ ] **Performance**: Activity Gallery loads 50+ entries with thumbnails in under 1 second.
