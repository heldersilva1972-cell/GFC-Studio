================================================================================
PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT
================================================================================
This document is the authoritative continuation report for the **GFC New Website**,
the public-facing site of the GFC Ecosystem. It is written so it can be uploaded
into any future chat and allow development to continue with certainty and without
assumptions.

- Includes ONLY explicitly discussed items plus clearly marked REQUIRED GAPS
- No speculative features
- No placeholders
- Clear execution order and Prompt Paths for Cursor

================================================================================
SECTION A – ORIGINAL PROJECT INTENT (HISTORICAL TRUTH)
================================================================================
The GFC New Website was intended to:
- Replace or modernize the existing public GFC website
- Present a modern, responsive, animated public presence
- Integrate with **GFC Web Studio** for content and animations
- Remain strictly public-facing (no membership/admin logic)
- Support future growth (events, rentals, content updates)

It is NOT:
- A replacement for the GFC Web App
- A place for access control, dues, or member data
- An admin dashboard (editing happens via Studio)

STATUS: COMPLETE (direction)

C2. Studio Dependency (PARTIAL)
- Studio exists conceptually and architecturally
- Content ingestion contract not yet finalized

STATUS: PARTIAL

C3. Website Implementation (NOT VERIFIED)
- No verified production-ready implementation exists
- No declared cutover from the legacy site

================================================================================
SECTION D – CONTENT CLASSIFICATION & SECURITY BOUNDARIES
================================================================================

D1. Public vs Internal Content Classification (EXPLICIT RULE)
- Public Website MAY contain:
  - marketing content
  - public history
  - public event information

  - photos intended for public viewing
- Public Website MUST NOT contain:
  - membership records
  - dues/payment data
  - access control information

D2. Data Access Boundary (EXPLICIT RULE)
- The public website MUST NOT:
  - connect directly to the GFC Web App database
  - read membership or operational tables
- Content access occurs ONLY via:
  - Studio-produced content
  - read-only public artifacts/APIs approved for public use

================================================================================
SECTION E – STATIC ASSET HANDLING (REQUIRED GAP)
================================================================================

[REQUIRED GAP – STATIC ASSET STRATEGY]
The handling of static assets has not yet been finalized.

Open decisions:
- Where images, PDFs, and documents are stored:
  - Studio-managed storage
  - CDN
  - Public bucket
- How assets are referenced by Studio content
- Caching and invalidation strategy

This decision impacts:
- Website performance
- Deployment model
- Backup strategy

================================================================================
SECTION F – CONTENT LIFECYCLE (REQUIRED GAP)
================================================================================

[REQUIRED GAP – CONTENT LIFECYCLE]
The draft/preview/publish workflow has not yet been finalized.

Unresolved questions:
- How admins preview content before it is live
- How Studio marks content as published
- Whether the website supports preview URLs or staging builds
- How accidental publishes are prevented

================================================================================
SECTION G – LEGACY WEBSITE RELATIONSHIP
================================================================================

G1. Legacy Website as a Reference (EXPLICIT)
- The existing GFC website is considered a **content reference**
- Historical content should not be lost unintentionally

G2. Migration Strategy (NOT DECIDED)
- No automated scraping or ingestion strategy was approved
- No manual migration workflow was finalized
- Content inventory and migration approach must be decided

[REQUIRED GAP – CONTENT MIGRATION STRATEGY]
Options that must be evaluated:
- Manual inventory + rewrite into Studio
- Assisted extraction + human normalization
- Hybrid approach
- Fresh rewrite using legacy site as reference only
