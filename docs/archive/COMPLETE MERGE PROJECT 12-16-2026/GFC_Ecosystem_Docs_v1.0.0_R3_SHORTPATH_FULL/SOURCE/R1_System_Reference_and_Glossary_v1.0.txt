DOCUMENT: System Reference & Glossary
VERSION: 1.0
STATUS: ACTIVE
SCOPE: ALL PROJECTS
AUTHORITY: SYSTEM GOVERNANCE
==================================================

PURPOSE
This document defines the authoritative terminology, document taxonomy,
statuses, dependencies, and rules of reference used across the entire
Project Tracker system. Its purpose is to eliminate ambiguity, prevent
mislabeling, and ensure deterministic continuity across chats, documents,
and execution.

This document is READ-ONLY by default and changes infrequently.

==================================================
SECTION 1 — PHYSICAL DOCUMENT SET (LOCKED)
==================================================

The system operates with exactly SIX (6) physical documents.

1) System Governance & Execution Rules
   - Absolute authority
   - Overrides chat-level instructions
   - Defines execution constraints, fail-fast rules, delta rules

2) System Reference & Glossary (this document)
   - Canonical definitions and relationships
   - No execution logic
   - No evidence

3) CSS — Current System Snapshot
   - Evidence-backed description of current system state
   - Versioned and time-sensitive
   - May become STALE

4) Change & Planning Record
   - Intent capture (CIR)
   - Decisions
   - Execution planning and steps

5) Work & Proof
   - Execution records
   - Completion proof
   - Issues, blocks, fixes, deltas

6) Project Snapshot (Cassette)
   - Immutable export
   - Includes copies of documents 1–5 plus logs
   - Never edited

No other physical documents are permitted.

==================================================
SECTION 2 — CORE RECORD TYPES (INTERNAL)
==================================================

CIR — Change & Intent Record
- Captures the reason, scope, and constraints for a change
- Contains no execution steps
- Must exist before planning

CSS — Current System Snapshot
- Captures verified reality
- Derived from evidence (e.g., PowerShell outputs)
- Required before execution

CR — Completion Record
- Confirms a step is complete
- References verification method and evidence

FIXREC — Fix Record
- Documents defects or regressions
- May generate DELTA prompts

BLOCKREC — Block Record
- Explains why progress is blocked
- Lists missing prerequisites

DELTA
- A corrective change to a prior execution
- References original Prompt ID and Revision

==================================================
SECTION 3 — STATUS DEFINITIONS (CANONICAL)
==================================================

DRAFT
- Incomplete, not approved

ACTIVE
- Approved and in effect

BLOCKED
- Cannot proceed due to missing prerequisites

STALE
- No longer reflects current reality

COMPLETED
- Finished and verified

SUPERSEDED
- Replaced by a newer version

==================================================
SECTION 4 — DEPENDENCY RULES (WHAT BLOCKS WHAT)
==================================================

- Execution is BLOCKED without an ACTIVE CSS
- Planning is BLOCKED without a completed CIR
- Prompts are BLOCKED without Governance acknowledgment
- Completion is INVALID without Proof
- Cassette generation is BLOCKED if any document is STALE

==================================================
SECTION 5 — MERGE & SEPARATION RULES
==================================================

- Governance MUST NOT be merged with other documents
- CSS MUST remain standalone
- Work & Proof MUST remain separate from planning
- Cassette is a generated artifact, not an editable document

==================================================
SECTION 6 — NAMING & VERSIONING RULES
==================================================

- Versions use MAJOR.MINOR
- Revisions increment on content change
- Status must be declared in header
- Filenames must include version when exported

==================================================
SECTION 7 — CHAT CONTINUITY RULES
==================================================

- New chats MUST reference Governance and Intake documents
- Past decisions MUST NOT be reinterpreted
- Summaries MUST NOT replace artifacts when documents are requested
- If continuity cannot be established, the AI MUST STOP
