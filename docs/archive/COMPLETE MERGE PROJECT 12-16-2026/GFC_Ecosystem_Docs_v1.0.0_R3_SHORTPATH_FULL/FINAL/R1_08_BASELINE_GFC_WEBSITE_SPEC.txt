GFC WEBSITE BASELINE SPEC — STUDIO-READY (FROM OPTION B SNAPSHOT)
Document: GFC_Website_Baseline_StudioReady
Version: v1.0.0
Revision: R1
Status: FINAL (inputs confirmed: Option B snapshot = truth source; Payments = placeholders)
Generated: 2025-12-16 (Asia/Taipei)

====================================================================
0) GOAL
====================================================================
Create a modern, top-of-the-line baseline of gloucesterfraternityclub.com inside the GFC Ecosystem using:
- Studio as the ONLY no-code authoring system for website pages, tiles, media presentation, and animations.
- Web App as the ONLY system-of-record for workflows, data, permissions, audit, publish execution, and runtime.
- GFC Mobile as a new phone-first companion UI (later phase) governed by Web App permissions.

Baseline output:
- A complete “GFC Site” (dedicated site) inside Studio with page templates and initial content structure aligned to the current site.
- Hall Rentals public area + application workflow scaffolding (payments placeholders only).
- Events/Alerts editor scaffolding.
- Media library usage patterns.
- A build sequence that Cursor can implement safely in phases.

====================================================================
1) INPUT TRUTH SOURCE (OPTION B SNAPSHOT)
====================================================================
Source: PowerShell snapshot folder (_SOURCE_SNAPSHOTS/GFC_SITE_YYYYMMDD/):
- pages/*.html (page snapshots)
- link_index.csv (internal link graph)
- asset_index.csv (referenced assets)

Rules:
- Snapshot is reference truth for existing site structure + content extraction.
- We do NOT copy WordPress theme code; we rebuild modern UI in the new stack.
- Any content not found in snapshot must be treated as “needs manual entry/confirmation.”

====================================================================
2) SITE MODEL (DEDICATED SITE + OPTIONAL EXPANSION)
====================================================================
2.1 Primary Site
- SiteId: GFC
- Name: “Gloucester Fraternity Club”
- Studio opens directly to this site (no site picker when only one AllowedSiteId exists)

2.2 Allowed Sites (Future)
- Studio.AllowedSiteIds = [GFC, ...]
- If more than one: show site picker; otherwise remain “dedicated mode.”

====================================================================
3) CANONICAL PAGE LIST (GFC SITE BASELINE)
====================================================================
Pages are created as Studio-authored pages backed by Web App storage and governed publish.

P0 — Home
P1 — History
P2 — Hall Rentals (hub page)
  P2.1 — Policy
  P2.2 — Pricing
  P2.3 — Availability Calendar
  P2.4 — Apply to Rent
  P2.5 — Ask a Question (Hall-specific contact)
P3 — Events
P4 — Photos
P5 — Contact
P6 — Special Needs

Notes:
- If Option B snapshot shows additional pages/sections, they must be mapped into either:
  - new page(s) (if real and required), or
  - a section on an existing page (preferred to keep nav clean).

====================================================================
4) REQUIRED BLOCK / TILE LIBRARY (BASELINE MINIMUM)
====================================================================
4.1 Layout / Containers
- Section
- Container (max width)
- Columns (2/3)
- Spacer / Divider

4.2 Content
- Hero (title/subtitle/CTA + optional background image)
- RichText (formatted text)
- Image
- Button / CTA
- FAQ Accordion
- Notice Banner (can be driven by Alerts)
- Embed / Widget container (for calendar/form widgets rendered by Web App modules)

4.3 Lists / Data-driven
- EventsList (upcoming, filtered)
- PhotoGallery (grid, carousel)
- RentalsCalendarWidget (read-only)
- RentalsApplyWidget (application form)
- SalesEventWidget (future, for sweet bread)

4.4 Navigation / Footer
- Header nav
- Footer with contact info, social links, quick links

4.5 Animation hooks (baseline capability)
- Per-block animation selector + parameter panel
- Safe defaults + “reduced motion” respect
- Animations are assets; blocks reference assets with per-instance params

====================================================================
5) HALL RENTALS BASELINE (PUBLIC + WORKFLOW + PLACEHOLDERS)
====================================================================
5.1 Public Hall Rentals Area (Website pages)
- Hall Rentals hub page: overview, quick CTAs (Apply / Calendar / Pricing / Policy)
- Policy page: snapshot-derived text and structure
- Pricing page: snapshot-derived structure; allow future updates from Studio
- Availability Calendar page: RentalsCalendarWidget (read-only, shows status)
- Apply page: RentalsApplyWidget (submits to Web App workflow)
- Ask a Question page: HallContactWidget (routes to designated recipients)

5.2 Submission behavior (locked)
- On Apply submit:
  - Create HallRentalRequest (Web App)
  - Create Temporary Hold on selected date/time immediately
  - Email designated recipients + applicant confirmation
- Holds:
  - duration, extension rules, expiration behavior configurable in Web App settings

5.3 Payments (placeholders now, real later)
- Public pages include optional “Payment placeholder panel”:
  - “Online deposits coming soon”
  - “Online balance payments coming soon”
- Web App stores deposit/balance fields and statuses for manual tracking until Stripe integration phase.

====================================================================
6) EVENTS / ALERTS BASELINE
====================================================================
6.1 Events module (Studio editor + Web App records)
- Studio provides quick add/update + scheduling window + archive
- Web App stores lifecycle and audit

6.2 Alerts/Banners
- Web App owns alert records
- Studio places Alert blocks where they appear (home banner, etc.)
- Display windows and optional countdown supported

====================================================================
7) SALES EVENTS BASELINE (SWEET BREAD — FUTURE PAYMENTS)
====================================================================
7.1 Sales Event Type (Web App)
- Represents a sellable event with inventory and sales window:
  - item(s), quantity limits, per-order limits
  - SalesWindowStart/End
  - optional countdown
  - sold-out behavior

7.2 Public Website display (Studio)
- SalesEventWidget blocks can be placed on Home and/or Events pages
- Reservation-only now; payment placeholder displayed
- Web App tracks orders, quantities, purchaser info, pickup status

====================================================================
8) MEDIA BASELINE
====================================================================
8.1 Studio Media Library UX
- Drag/drop or folder select
- Preview before save
- Assign to pages, events, rentals, sales events, galleries
- “Used by” references

8.2 Web App ownership
- Storage, thumbnails, optimization, constraints, audit, safe delete with impact warnings

====================================================================
9) PREVIEW / PUBLISH BASELINE BEHAVIOR
====================================================================
- All website content changes are Draft + Preview + Publish.
- Preview renders in the real website runtime “Preview context”:
  - draft pages + draft animations
  - no side effects (no analytics, no notifications)
  - environment + preview badge always visible
- Publish executed only by Web App after validation and audit logging.

====================================================================
10) BASELINE BUILD SEQUENCE (CURSOR-SAFE)
====================================================================
Phase 1 — Baseline Website + Studio Shell
- Site registry (PrimarySiteId=GFC; AllowedSiteIds=[GFC])
- Studio shell: left palette + canvas + properties + multi-device preview
- Block registry + initial blocks (Section/Container/Hero/RichText/Image/Button/etc.)
- Page creation for canonical page list
- Draft/preview/publish pipeline for pages (no rentals workflow yet)
- Media library baseline (upload + select + preview)

Phase 2 — Hall Rentals Core Workflow
- Hall rentals data model: Request, Hold, Booking, Calendar entries, Blocks
- Public Apply + Ask Question forms
- Temporary holds + expiration rules
- Admin workflow queue + detail actions
- RentalsCalendarWidget for website
- Studio Hall Rentals module (calendar editor + preview)

Phase 3 — Events/Alerts + Sales Events (Sweet Bread)
- Events editor + scheduling + archive
- Alerts with display windows + optional countdown
- Sales Event type + reservation + countdown + inventory + admin tracking
- Public SalesEventWidget placement in Studio

Phase 4 — GFC Mobile (New Project)
- Auth via Web App + module access matrix
- Hall Rentals mobile: calendar + queue + fast actions
- (Optional later) Sales event fulfillment view: totals, pickup marking

Phase 5 — Payments (Later, after placeholders)
- Stripe test mode + webhooks + receipts + refunds
- Deposit/balance payment links for rentals
- Payment for sales events

====================================================================
11) ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (BASELINE COMPLETE)
====================================================================
Baseline is considered complete when:
- Studio can render and edit the GFC site pages with drag/drop blocks, no code required.
- Multi-device preview works (phone/tablet/desktop).
- Draft changes do not affect public site until Publish.
- Hall Rentals pages exist with Apply + Calendar widgets (workflow in later phase).
- Events page exists with event list area (data-driven block) and editable content sections.
- Media library supports upload + preview + placement.
- Documentation confirms sandboxes and future payment placeholders.
