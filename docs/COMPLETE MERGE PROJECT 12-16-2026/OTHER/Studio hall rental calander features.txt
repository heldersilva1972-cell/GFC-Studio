Below is a **single, authoritative reconstruction** of everything that was **actually discussed** about the **Hall Rental Calendar**, followed by **2–3 UX models** that fit those discussions, and a **precise list of Studio features required vs optional**.
This is **no guessing**: where something was not finalized, it’s marked as such.

# Hall Rental Calendar — Authoritative Feature Specification

**Scope:** Web App (business logic) + Website (public view) + Studio (presentation)
**Status:** Reconstructed from discussions; execution-grade where decided; gaps explicitly marked

---

## 1) Ownership & Authority (Finalized)

### 1.1 Source of Truth

* **Web App is the sole authority** for:

  * Hall rental records
  * Availability rules
  * Conflicts (max events/day, gaps, blocked dates)
  * Pricing, deposits, approvals, lifecycle
* **Studio does NOT own data** and **cannot edit rentals**.
* **Website is read-only** for availability and details; it initiates requests only.

**Why:** Rentals are business operations; content tools must not bypass rules.

**Status:** **Finalized**

---

## 2) Public Behavior & Guarantees (Finalized)

### 2.1 Public Calendar Guarantees

* Displays **availability clearly** (Available / Booked / Pending / Blocked).
* **Mobile-first**, modern UI (not spreadsheet/admin grid).
* **Read-only** calendar; clicking leads to **Apply / Request Date** flow.
* Shows **future availability** within configured window (range configurable in Web App).

**Status:** **Finalized intent**

### 2.2 What the Public Calendar Must NOT Do

* Must not allow drag/drop bookings.
* Must not allow editing rental data.
* Must not show internal notes or admin-only fields.

**Status:** **Finalized**

---

## 3) Web App Responsibilities (Finalized Rules)

### 3.1 Business Rules (Examples explicitly discussed)

* Max events per day (e.g., 2/day).
* Required gap between events.
* Blocked dates/holidays.
* Approval workflow.
* Deposits/payments (future-ready).

**Status:** **Finalized**

### 3.2 API Contract (Required)

* Read-only endpoints for:

  * Calendar range availability
  * Day-level status
  * Event summaries (public-safe fields only)
* Write endpoints only for:

  * Application/request submission (not booking).

**Status:** **Finalized intent** (endpoints not implemented)

---

## 4) Studio’s Role (Finalized Boundaries)

### 4.1 What Studio Controls

* **Presentation only**:

  * Layout of the calendar
  * Styling and theming
  * Animations (non-intrusive)
  * Surrounding content (headers, explanations, CTAs)
* Placement of the calendar within pages.
* Optional visual indicators (icons, color legends).

**Status:** **Finalized**

### 4.2 What Studio Does NOT Control

* Availability calculations
* Booking decisions
* Approval or pricing logic
* Date blocking

**Status:** **Finalized**

---

## 5) Animations & Interactions (Partially Discussed)

### 5.1 What Was Discussed (Not Finalized)

* Subtle animations for:

  * Day hover/focus
  * Status transitions (Available ↔ Booked)
  * Countdown indicators for upcoming events
* Animations must:

  * Be **optional**
  * Respect **reduced motion**
  * Never obscure data

**Status:** **Exploratory / Under Review**

---

## 6) Editing & Admin Experience (Finalized Boundaries)

* All **editing** of rentals happens in the **Web App admin UI**.
* Studio users can:

  * Place/configure the calendar block
  * Choose visual options
* Studio users **cannot**:

  * Modify rental entries
  * Override availability

**Status:** **Finalized**

# Calendar UX Models (Consistent With Discussions)

## UX Model A — Monthly Availability Grid (Primary)

**Best fit for what you asked for**

**Description**

* Month grid with days color-coded:

  * Available
  * Booked
  * Pending
  * Blocked
* Clicking a day:

  * Shows a lightweight detail panel
  * CTA: “Request This Date”

**Why it fits**

* Familiar
* Clean
* Mobile-friendly
* Clearly communicates availability

**Status:** **Recommended**

---

## UX Model B — Agenda / List View (Secondary)

**Optional companion view**

**Description**

* Chronological list of upcoming dates/events.
* Shows availability labels.
* Filters (month, availability).

**Why it fits**

* Easier on mobile for scanning
* Accessibility-friendly

**Status:** **Optional**

---

## UX Model C — Hybrid Month + Detail Panel

**More modern, still consistent**

**Description**

* Month grid on top
* Selecting a date expands a detail panel below (no modal).
* Smooth, subtle transitions.

**Why it fits**

* Modern feel
* Avoids popups
* Keeps context

**Status:** **Optional / Under Review**

---

# Required Studio Features (Exact)

## REQUIRED (Must Exist)

1. **Calendar Display Block**

   * Read-only
   * Binds to Web App availability API
   * Configurable date range
   * Status legend

2. **Styling Controls**

   * Colors for statuses
   * Typography
   * Spacing

3. **Layout Placement**

   * Full-width / contained
   * Section placement rules

4. **CTA Configuration**

   * Button text (“Apply”, “Request Date”)

---

## OPTIONAL (Discussed but Not Required)

   * Hover effects
   * Status change transitions
   * Reduced-motion compliant

2. **Multiple Views Toggle**

   * Month ↔ Agenda

---

# Explicit Gaps (Intentionally Not Guessed)

These were **not finalized** and must be decided before implementation:

* Exact color semantics (what color = what state)
* Default date range shown (3 months? 6 months?)
* Whether “Pending” is shown publicly or hidden
* Tooltip vs panel vs modal for details
* Whether pricing is shown on the calendar or only on apply page

---

## Bottom-Line Truth

> We **fully agreed on authority, boundaries, and intent** for the Hall Rental Calendar.
> We **did not** yet finalize the **exact UX mechanics or animation rules** — and that’s correct.

---

## Next (when you want)

I can:

* Lock **one UX model** as final
* Produce the **Studio Calendar Block spec** (execution-grade)
* Produce the **Web App API spec** for availability
* Generate **Cursor prompts** in the correct order

Tell me which one to do first.
