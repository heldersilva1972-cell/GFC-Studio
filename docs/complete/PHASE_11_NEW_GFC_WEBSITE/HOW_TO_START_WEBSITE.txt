# 🚀 ONE-CLICK WEBSITE LAUNCHER

## How to Use:

### Option 1: Double-Click the Batch File (EASIEST)

1. Find the file: **`start-website.bat`** in the main GFC-Studio V2 folder
2. **Double-click it**
3. A terminal window will open and automatically:
   - Install dependencies (first time only)
   - Start the website server
   - Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

**Keep the terminal window open while using the website!**

---

### Option 2: From the Web App

1. Make sure the website server is running (use Option 1 first)
2. In the Web App, click "Public Website"
3. The website will open in a new tab

---

## First Time Setup:

The **first time** you run `start-website.bat`, it will:
- Install all dependencies (takes 2-3 minutes)
- Start the server
- Open your browser

**After the first time**, it will start instantly!

---

## To Stop the Website:

In the terminal window that opened, press **Ctrl + C**

---

## What You'll See:

When the website loads, you'll see:
- ✅ Modern hero section with gradient background
- ✅ "Building Community, Friendship, and Tradition Since 1923"
- ✅ Stats: 100+ Years, 500+ Members, 50+ Events
- ✅ 6 feature cards with all content from current site
- ✅ Contact information
- ✅ "Back to Admin" button (bottom right)

---

## Troubleshooting:

**If port 3000 is already in use:**
- Close any other programs using port 3000
- Or edit the batch file to use a different port

**If dependencies fail to install:**
- Open Command Prompt as Administrator
- Navigate to the website folder
- Run: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

---

**That's it! Just double-click `start-website.bat` and you're ready to go! 🎉**
