# GFC Project: Mandatory Rules for AI Agents

## 1. Documentation & Plan Updates
- **NEVER** modify a file in the `docs/` directory without updating the `Version` number and `REVISION HISTORY` table.
- The update to the tracking info must be part of the **SAME** edit as the content changes.
- If a document does not have a revision history, you must **CREATE** one before making changes.

## 2. Synchronization
- Always notify the user when a task is complete.
- Prompt for a git pull/push as per project protocols.

## 3. Communication
- Be precise, follow the established design language, and respect project architectural boundaries.
